## Features

AgentConnect offers a range of features to help you manage your clients effectively.

### Understanding Command Format

- **Words in UPPER_CASE** are placeholders for information you need to provide.  
  Example: In `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the client's name.

- **Square brackets [ ]** indicate optional items.  
  Example: `n/NAME [t/TAG]` means the `t/TAG` part is optional.

- **Ellipsis ...** means you can include the item multiple times or not at all.  
  Example: `[t/TAG]...` allows for multiple tags or none.

- **Order Doesn't Matter**  
  You can enter the parameters in any order.  
  Example: `n/John p/123` is the same as `p/123 n/John`.

- **Extra Parameters are Ignored**  
  For commands that don't require additional input, any extra text will be ignored.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
